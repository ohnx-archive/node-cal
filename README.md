node-cal is a nodejs calendar module.

it allows someone to create new events, add them to a calendar, and then export that calendar to an `iCal` (AKA `ics`) format.

it is also possible to convert a calendar or a calendar event to a JSON format, and then read that same JSON format back into a calendar format.

## planned items

 - iCal parser
